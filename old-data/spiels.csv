"identityinasoiaf", "Academic presentation from Andrew Jones. In the series A Song of Ice and Fire, George RR Martin has highlighted the conflict of identity which results and promotes conflict with the unknown. Over the series almost every character has an identity, therefore establishing an emotional connection between the reader and the character. Despite this extensive identification, the series is also well known for the use of otherisation. Portraying that which is identifiable through conflict with that which cannot be identified. Over the course of the novels this duality explores how those reading the novel encounter the relationship between the known and the unknown."

"‘I Love You... Bro’: LGBTQ subtext in genre TV, from Star Trek to Supernatural, with Jenny Alexander", "Despite the emergence, since Willow came out on Buffy in 2000, of overt LGBT representation in sci-fi and fantasy television, “hidden”, hinted at, same-sex romance, in the subtext of genre shows, continues to be significant. BBC’s Merlin, the CW’s Supernatural, MTV’s Teen Wolf and ABC’s Once Upon a Time have all recently made use of it. In a very different era from the 1960s, when the Captain of the Enterprise and his Vulcan First Officer inspired Kirk / Spock fan fiction, is there a progressive place for queer subtext, or is it, today, an exploitative marketing tactic, known in fan culture discussion as “queerbaiting”?"
"gendertroubleinavatargenderasperformativeinavatarthelastairbender", "We explore how gender is written on the animated body using theories of Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble and Nickelodeon cartoon, Avatar: The Last Airbender. We’ll look in three chapters at drag, performativity and gender subversion in The Warriors of Kyoshi; performance and unstable identities in The Ember Island Players; and melancholic gender identity in the characters Katara and Azula."
"Deadly Little Bodies: The Silent Asian Female Assassins in Contemporary Comics, with Kelly Kanayama", "From Cheshire to Lady Shiva, the East Asian female assassin is a common character type in contemporary comics. Although their fighting abilities are often presented as a sign of empowerment, in practice depictions of these characters often combine Orientalist portrayals of female Asian identity with stereotypes regarding Asian culture. This trend gives rise to a particularly problematic character subtype: the East Asian female assassin who lacks the power of speech."
"We Come In Peace: Immigration In Post-Cold War Science Fiction Film, with Samantha Kountz", "Using Homi Bhaba’s “The Other Question”, Rick Altman’s methods in reading genre, and structuralism to examine how mainstream post-Cold War science fiction films such as Star Wars: Episodes I-III, Men In Black, District 9, Alien Nation, The Coneheads, Man of Steel, and Elysium depict aliens in terms of race, class, gender, and citizenship, there is a clear reflection of contemporary anti-immigrant sentiment. The conclusion can be made that these films’ persistent imagining of worlds in which aliens are forced to completely assimilate culturally and physically is symbolic of a subconscious desire for this enforcement as a “resolution”."
"terrypratchettsdiscworldandphilosophyorhowgrannyweatherwaxoutnietzschesnietzsche", "Philosophers love long words – ideally ones only understood by people who have been spending too much time in small rooms with the curtains drawn, instead of getting out in the healthy fresh air. We’re not that kind though – we’re the kind who, when trapped in a room full of mirrors will look down and say: ‘This one’. It is, after all, important to know what’s really real. Nonetheless there is some interesting stuff to be found in the philosophy of roundworld and this session draws on both universes to lead an interactive discussion about how each philosophy informs the other."
"Christian Theology and Culture in Terry Pratchett’s Small Gods, with Rev Phil Bettinson", "Small Gods follows the story of Brutha, the only believer in the city, as he comes to terms with the fact that his God, normally seen as a mighty Bull, has come to him in the shape of a tortoise. The tortoise, better known as the Great God Om, learns a lot about what it means to be a God as he struggles with his new limited form and is reminded of his origins. Brutha’s journey through the book helps both him, and Om, grow in understanding of one another. The story has many obvious parallels with the Christian Faith. The book offers criticisms, and interesting approaches to the faith, and theology. Here, we’ll explore these differences, and to see what kind of interaction there is between the cultural view shown in book and a modern understanding of Christian theology."
"Fallen Gods and Malignant Devils: Marvel’s Early Modern Magical and Martial Antecedents", "With Comics Fandom. Dr. Briony Frost discusses Loki, Thor, fallen gods, and military-magical power. This paper will consider the relationship between nature and science, and heroes and villains, through Loki’s increasingly industrialized magic, and the more heavily militarised “hero” figures of Thor and Tony Stark."
"selfidentityinyadystopianfictionhowterribleworldsareaforceforgoodinours", "This paper discusses, with a focus on three dystopian texts, how the emerging self-identity of YA protagonists intertwines with the class, gender and race-based identities of YA readers, to create a growing potential for political engagement. Fiction and reality blur in novelised worlds of diametrically opposed social classes, glorified masculinity, and devastating narratives of privilege and injustice. Through the work of Suzanne Collins, Patrick Ness and Malorie Blackman, I will argue that dystopian fiction is the ideal genre of literature for young adults, as they negotiate their own unjust and often terrifying world."
"My Little Pony: Audience, Identity and Animation, with Ewan Kirkland", "The unprecedented success of the rebooted My Little Pony series amongst adult male fans raises questions concerning the relationship between screen audiences and particular forms of popular culture. This paper critically examines MLPFIM’s status as a show for young girls, in terms of animation historical, trends within the mainstream culture industry, and the format of the series itself. It is argued that despite its unexpected fandom, MLPFIM maintains the series’ traditional appeal to the franchise’s original demographic of young female viewers."
"readingamillionselfpublishedbooksvisualisingtrendsinwhatswrittenapilotstudy", "Last year publishers took over a million novels to market with many more being self-published. Nobody could read enough of this to know what people are writing about. How can academics and publishers who need to keep up, keep up? In scientific fields, the ‘data deluge’ is addressed by using software to summarise and index the knowledge externally from the researcher. My research focus is on emerging trends in science fiction. I am going to present a pilot study of 100 self-published sci-fi stories, exploring ways that we can navigate these documents and trends computationally, before reading the texts. "
"Male, Pale, and Stale: Character Creation in Gaming, with Helen Gould", "White male protagonists are highly overrepresented in an industry where anything can be created: aliens, elves, trolls, orcs, giant cuttlefish monsters that fire molten metal. A paper called “The Virtual Census”, published in 2009 in New Media & Society, found that male characters make up 85.2% of characters in games, with white characters at 80%. Needless to say, these statistics do not accurately represent gamers as a community. Here, I’ll discuss the ways in which character creation is a good alternative, and how it can have a positive effect on players who don’t fit the usual hero mould – as well as tackling some of the problems with it."
"‘Ideal’ Control Methods and Antisimulation, with Joseph Gavin", "Control schemes are not all designed to be the same. Instead, there are differing ‘ideal’ control schemes. While the usual two ‘ideals’ of control methods are the ‘arcade’ and the ‘simulation’, I’ll argue for the existence of a third, which I’ll call ‘antisimulation’. Arcade works through simplicity, ease, and empowerment, and simulation works through accuracy and specificity. Antisimulation works through over-specificity and incoherence. I’ll be building on my ‘Blogs of the Round Table’ entry for ‘The Right Touch’, ‘Intentionally Bad Controls, Anti-Simulation, and QWOP’, taking into account more research since, and also Peter Shafer’s response to that piece, ‘Control Schemes as Expression’."
"Environmental Narrative and the Silent Story, with Thryn Henderson", "Games as art is a heavily debated topic, where reviews and criticisms of the form are showing an increasing appreciation for a game with a well-crafted narrative to carry the gameplay along. Games writing is an expanding field, but a new challenge for many traditional writers, requiring new forms of narrative. Environmental narrative is the increasingly popular method of using visual and gameplay elements themselves to immerse you in the game world and provide an understanding of its history and events. Here, I’ll discuss the ways in which gameplay and narrative combine to create a convincing atmosphere."
"Actions, Choices, and Immersion: what can philosophers tell us? with John Brasington", "Are your actions in games, yours? Do we share the desires of our characters, have them, or emulate them? Do we think of ourselves as our characters, our avatars, or are we only sympathetic to them? The answers to these questions are different for every game, but with about five minutes of philosophy we can build a framework to understand and answer these questions. All you need is a knowledge of language and the patience to ask what words actually mean, and then we can talk about whether we act in games, whether we make choices, and why we can become immersed in them."
"Objection! What makes for a good adventure game puzzle, anyway? with Seb Atay", "“Use spork on rafflesia”; “use spork on necrotising bacteria”; “combine spork and antique silverware”; “give spork to tree”. We know what it feels like when an adventure game puzzle goes wrong, but what does it feel like when a puzzle goes right? The ideal of the adventure game puzzle is one that the player should solve by insight alone, and this has historically informed the design and development of the genre. However, this ideal dissolves on contact with the player’s experience, because some trial and error will always be required. We argue that fair puzzles help resolve this problem, and that furthermore fairness is instrumental in creating good puzzles. To that end, we provide a schema for assessing whether or not a given puzzle is fair."

Doctor Who fanvids have a long history of expressing love for the best the show has to offer, bringing new readings to characters and creating new stories for the Doctor and his companions. We look at our favourites before our panelists discuss trends in Doctor Who vidding, and ask the audience what they think. With Amy (such_heights) and Jenni Hughes."
"Queer in the Text", "There’s much queer subtext in classic Who, but there were no explicitly queer characters until the new series. Now we’ve got Captain Jack and the entire cast of Torchwood, River Song, Madame Vastra and Jenny, plus many minor characters. How successful have these representations been? Has the subtext been lost? Do we want it back? What subtext worked well in classic Who, and what sort of queer representation do we want to see today?"
"The Doctor’s Privilege", "The Time Lords are portrayed as an aristocracy, and though the Doctor rejected then destroyed his home, he still benefits from that birth right. He can travel anywhere in time or space, has no obligations, no need for money, and knows just about everything. Wherever he goes, he interferes and assumes authority. How aware is he of his privilege? Does he use his advantages for good, or is he no more than an idealised colonialist figure?"
"Wibbly-Wobbly Timey-Wimey Stuff: The Science of Time Travel in the Real World", "Astrophysicist and rocket scientist Stephanie Osborn talks about concepts in physics that might actually enable us to travel in time, and why they might – or might not – work."
"Why Continuity Doesn’t Matter", "How much of Doctor Who continuity really matters, and how much should we shrug at and carry on? So much of the Doctor Who universe is contradictory, accidental and not, and still nonfiction books try to give a complete history. But with five decades of stories, it can’t all fit neatly together. In the end, the books dumped a whole lot of continuity, and the new series initially did the same. Is any of it really important? Are there parts we really need to keep? What are the bits really worth arguing over?"
"Writing Circular Gallifreyan", "Come and learn Circular High Gallifreyan writing! We’ll be using the writing developed by Loren Sherman with permission, and we’ll provide all the materials and knowledge you need. Space is limited, so come promptly!"
"If A Woman Was Cast As The Doctor", "The argument of whether or not the Doctor can be a woman is over. Of course she can. The series even said so. Now let’s move on to a more interesting conversation and discuss how it could, would, and should have worked: would City of Death have turned into a beautiful sapphic adventure of love? How would Rose and Martha’s storylines have changed? And the Doctor and River’s marriage? What can we learn from the two times the Doctor has already been a woman? Is there anything that should be changed with the Doctor’s gender, or would we just be afraid of all the things the writers could feel obligated to change?"
"Received Fan Wisdom is Wrong", "There are so many things new fans of the show are told by Older, Wiser fans; things that have often been taken for granted as being true. We take a look at this Doctor Who Fan Wisdom and see when it holds up and when it doesn’t. What’re the great stories new fans are advised never to taint their eyes with? What terrible clunkers are regarded as classics? Which companions and Doctors’ reputations have suffered or gained from being over/under-rated in the eyes of fandom?"
"Anytime, Anywhere", "The Doctor can travel anywhere in time and space, and the pure historical story was a regular occurrence in the early days of the show, but has been seen only once since 1966. Would a pure historical work in today’s Doctor Who? Is there any time or place the Doctor should go that he hasn’t yet? Which historical figures does he really need to get around to meeting?"
"A Handy Guide to the Wilderness Years and Beyond", "Doctor Who isn’t just a telly show, it’s also books, audios, comics, webcasts, and computer games. In the nineties, these non-telly sources were the only place you could get (official) new Doctor Who stories. For telly fans looking to step into the worlds of book and audio, where do you even start? Our panel talks about the highs and lows of non-telly Who, and where you can find the good stuff."
"Representation of Gender Roles", "At its best Doctor Who challenges the normative gender roles of society, from Barbara's implicit rejection of the fifties ‘feminine mystique’ to Sarah Jane’s explicit rejection of seventies patriarchy. Ace and Rose are working class heroes. Madame Vastra and Jenny are a married interspecies couple who fight crime, and aliens, in Victorian London. How successfully does the show challenge prevailing gender norms? Where does it succeed best? Where could it do better?"
"RTD vs Lambert", "Verity Lambert and Russell T Davies: two Doctor Who producers making the same show fifty years apart and for very different audiences. Can an RTD fan go back and enjoy Lambert’s work? What does it have to offer the modern viewer? What does each era regard as heroic, and what does it teach us to fear? We look at the work of both producers’ eras and see how much has changed, and why, and whether it’s all for the better."
"Welcome Games and Vids: fic and word games, accompanied by favourite fanvids", "Join us for a relaxed evening of games and fanvids.

A fast-paced TED-style set of seven-minute presentations, in which nine people talk about their favourite fanwork -- why they love it, why they recommend it, what makes it stand out from other works by the same creator, whether it works without knowledge of canon ... As with last year’s Nine Myths About Fanfic session, participants will be timed by a samba-dancing green robot. We’re sorry."
"Fourth Wall Fandom: creator/fan interaction, gently crumbling the fourth wall", "Creators of canon are increasingly likely to interact with their fanbase, whether by referencing fannish tropes in the TV show / film / book, or by interacting with fans on social media platforms.

"Self-Worth For Fanfic Writers", "Mainstream authors are envious of the feedback and appreciation fanfic writers receive - but is positive feedback a good measure of self-worth? We discuss what matters most: hits, AO3 kudos, comments, bookmarks. Is it the truly insightful comment that shows you have at least one reader who gets exactly what you meant? Are any of these good metrics for success?"

The panel discuss the pros and cons of each approach, and how they are and how they affect fanworks."
"Slash and feminism: how can slash be a feminist activity?", "Male characters in canon are often more rounded, three-dimensional and credible than female characters. When we write M/M slash, are we reinforcing popular culture’s bias towards male characters, or are we reclaiming them? The panel examine arguments for and against slash as a feminist activity, and talk about genderbending, femslash and the marginalisation of female characters."
"How To Be A Better Beta: beta-reading, and teaching writing, in fandom", "Beta-reading is an art as well as a skill, and betas often go well beyond editing text.

"Fanfic for Kids: what happens next? Making up your own stories", "A reprise of last year’s successful discussion and workshop centred on fanfiction for pre-teens. Many fanfic writers begin writing fic at an early age, though we don’t know that that’s what we’re doing. What happens next? (Futurefic.) What if a character from this film met a character from that book? (Crossovers.) What would this hero be doing if they’d been born in the contemporary, mundane world? (AUs.) Many pre-teens also want to read fanfiction. What are the best (and safest) sites for them to visit? Are apps like NetNanny at all useful for toning down fic content?"

"Legitimacy and Monetisation of Fanworks: who owns an idea? Who profits from it?", "Retelling, embellishing and developing stories was once common. We look at how the ownership model has become prevalent been subverted by fanworks.

"Sexuality and Fanfic: exploring depictions of sexuality in fanworks", "The panel discuss the depiction of sexuality in fanfic. Many fanwriters are writing about sex acts that are outside their experience: others may be projecting their own experiences or fantasies onto canon characters. Why do some writers depict a particular character as generally straight, but 'gay for [insert name here]'? How accurate / credible are fanfic depictions of sex and sexuality? Why does it matter if we get things wrong?"
"Welcome Games and Vids, with the Fanfic track", "Join us for a relaxed evening of games and fanvids. We’ll be kickstarting the socialising and inspiring stories by setting up games of Slash: Romance Without Boundaries, Dixit and LeCardo. We’ll also be showing some favourite fanvids."

"Queer Eye For The Dead Guy – the secret queer history of the horror genre", "With the Queer Track, Micheal Blyth presents a revisionist history of horror through a queer lens. Illustrated with clips and images, he’ll explore everything from the glorious camp excesses of 1930s monster movies to the homoerotic romps of the 1980s and beyond. Looking at the horror films as AIDS metaphor, interrogating the unsettling demonisation of the transgendered body in the genre, and, of course, taking in a spot of vampiric lezploitation along the way, we’ll see how this often reviled genre has allowed filmmakers to explore radical ideas and taboos, and revel in the queerest of polymorphous desires and perversions."

"thebechdelfilmtestprosconsandbeyondanalysis", "With the Geek Feminism Track. The Bechdel Test asks if a film has two named women characters that talk to each other about something other than a man. It represents a minimum standard for portrayals of women in film, and is failed by most films.

He couldn’t foresee that it would be transnational corporations, not just governments, that would help usher in this new era. That instead of coercion, they would use the hegemony of unregulated capitalism to have us exchange our fundamental freedoms for access to modern life. He could not foretell a world where our corporeal selves enjoy fundamental freedoms but our digital selves — our simulations — are enslaved in corporate laboratories. Take a look at what it means to live in a world where our simulations have no rights, what that means for our fundamental freedoms and we can do about it."

Whatever your stance on the matter, there’s no denying sex is a pretty big part of our culture, and any game that tackles the subject of sex is “clearly more mature and an example of the progression of the industry”... or, is it? Our panel discuss portrayals of sex and sexuality in games, from the good to the bad to the downright bizarre. Panel: Cara Ellison, Esther MacCallum-Stewart"
"Cyborgs, Robots and Gender: reality vs fiction, and the body vs technology (16+)", "Science fiction narratives often imagine the body’s relationship to technology and how this might change what it means to be “human”. However, these changes are already happpening now, in the real world. The line between reality and fiction, body and technology is becoming increasingly blurry. The question is whether such technology will reinforce, or even exacerbate, existing gender inequalities or whether it gives us a tool that can allow us to transcend them. Talk by Fran Haswell."
"Policing the Net: Balancing Rights and Responsibilities (18+)", "Following reports that half of low-level crime is internet-related, the issue of online policing – and censorship – has never been hotter. Do minority groups need protection from online bullies, or should they just grow a thicker skin? Is Internet freedom worth aspiring to, or is it just shorthand for survival of the fittest? Are jokes “just a joke”? Is porn a barrier to women online? Or is our obsession with sanitizing the internet imposing moral norms that ultimately harm the minorities we want to protect.

Panel: Zalia Chimera, David Bryher, Naomi Alderman, Phil Nightingale, Rebecca Levene"
"Assaulting the Narrative: Rape as Character Motivation (16+)", "From Game of Thrones to Lara Croft’s retconned backstory, sexual assault saturates narrative.

This popular rule has obvious power for subverting male-dominated media and potential for introducing trans narratives.

With Tab Kimpton, Zen Cho, Alex Dally MacFarlane, more TBC"

"Interrogating The Old Shows: Retro Fandoms and Cultural Critique", "The passage of time has excused a multitude of sins in design and production values on shows now considered Retro. Can, or should, we do the same with issues of sexual, gender and racial politics, by viewing them in their historic and cultural contexts, or should some shows and episodes be deemed unwatchable for a new generation of fans? How do original fans of these shows feel while rewatching them at decades’ distance?

The Longitude Act famously offered life-changing rewards to anyone who could solve the ‘unsolvable’: finding a ship's position at sea. Successful ideas came forward eventually, but hundreds of other projects proved to be dead ends. Richard Dunn, who has helped put the Season together, will look back at the miscellany of schemes sent to the Board of Longitude, thinking about the extent to which they were crazy (or not) and how they have inspired steampunk artists today. We’ll explore some of the schemes that didn’t work but could today, and think about innovation and the difficult process of getting inventions made in the Age of Enlightenment."

"Steampunk Fashion", "The whole Steampunk Track team will strut their stuff in a fashion show. Each of our crew will show you how to put together many styles of outfits - it’s not just about wearing goggles and brown."
"indiehavenchats", "The wonderful people from Indie Haven will be on hand all day chatting to indie developers new and old about their games and the rest of games culture."
"Indie Marketing", "You may have unparalleled art direction, the finest narrative immersion, and the most satisfying mechanics, but if no-one has heard of your game then no-one will be able to appreciate all your hard work. Our panel of press, marketing and PR people will give you the best tips on how to get people playing your games."
"Failing Faster", "Every good game starts with a great idea – you know, for the story, the gameplay, the worldbuilding, the scripting, the...wait. Stop. There’s a better way to get going, and that’s the idea of failing faster: you’ll have a lot of failures before you hit the right approach, and the sooner you find them, the easier they’ll be to fix. Instead of trying to do everything at once, we’ll talk about the best ways to get your prototypes up to speed – and avoid having to scrap everything over one tiny mistake!"
"Meet all the people", "Carrying on from the morning’s Indie Haven chats, the team will be around, looking to talk games with anyone and everyone! And, since we expect they’ll be swamped, we’re also opening this up to everyone. Got a game you want some feedback on? Looking to meet other UK devs? Or maybe you just really like playing games and fancy seeing what other people are up to? This slot will be whatever you want it to be, so come along and get involved!"
"Game Police vs Indies", "Video games are still a rapidly evolving medium which are trying to find themselves within the wider cultural context. And in such a medium, packed with talented people who are constantly pushing the limits of what games can be, is it even possible to say what a game is any more? Of course it is. According to the Game Police, anyway! Come see them take the indies who dare to create “things which are not games” to task!"
"Need-to-Know About The Indie Life", "So, you want to be an indie dev. Or maybe you are, but you’re wondering if you quite ‘get’ how things are done. We’ll look at the pitfalls, the problems and potential financial woes you might encounter – alongside the best way to chat to your fans, and getting to know the UK scene. Basically, if it’d be a useful thing for you to know, we’ll talk about it. And if we don’t? There’s plenty of chance for questions!"
"The Mechanisms", "The Mechanisms are a bunch of steampunk space pirates who enjoy telling stories about their exploits through the medium of music. Give our game jam theme of fairytale retellings, we thought we’d leave you time to enjoy them first hand! Go check out their sets: Ulysses Dies at Dawn and High Noon Over Camelot."
"Philosophy in Games", "Ever wondered whether video games have the potential to allow us to test out ethical theories and how practical they are (hint: yes). Or perhaps you’re wondering if the deterministic nature of the genre can tell us something about our own world (hint: yes). Maybe you’re just wondering about the nature of identity, and if anyone has looked at the implications of an online avatar (hint: yes). Come and join in our discussion of philosophy and games, where we’ll look at all this and more."
"Personal games", "Most people think of the novel or poetry as the domain of personal reflection, but gaming has a lot of potential for dealing with personal issues. Thanks to its interactivity and the ability to use more than just text, games are a great place to engage people’s empathy rather than sympathy. Imagine being able to step into the shoes of someone struggling with mental illness, or experience first hand the difficulties of mending broken relationships rather than simply hearing about them. That’s what gaming allows you to do, and that’s what we’ll look at in this panel."
"Advanced Twine Workshop", "So you’ve got the basics of Twine down: you’ve made a few stories, remembered some variables and maybe even played with the styling. But maybe you want to see what else it can do? Well, this is the session to show you just that: arrays, objects, macros and more, we’ll show you how to get your games to do exactly what you want. Bring a laptop to work on your own stuff, or just check out the others."
"Cara’s Fireside", "Rounding out the convention in front of Cara’s fireplace for a relaxed evening chat about life, video games, and whatever catches her and her guest’s interest."
"The Symbolism and Metaphor of Buffy, with Shane Davis", "Exploring the subtle and less than subtle symbols Buffy uses to comment on real life. This talk breaks down the hidden messages throughout the show to perhaps explain why Buffy resonates so well with fans. Come and share what you, personally, have taken from Buffy too."
"Avengers Jossemble! Burdened With Glorious Squee, with Tlanti", "With the movie and characters inspiring cosplays, fan fiction, fan art and interest in the characters, let’s celebrate what this colourful, action packed movie has inspired!"
"The Joss Whedon Quiz", "A quiz on all things Whedon. Assemble your own team of six, or come along to be placed with fellow fans!"
"shutthatcrazymouthexploringtheconceptofmentalhealthandmadnessinthewhedonverse", "Joss Whedon is well-known for writing diverse and unusual characters with a whole host of personal insanities and torments, from Buffy’s deathwish and River Tam’s schizophrenia to Echo’s multipile identity crises. But how accurate are his depictions of mental illness, and have they done anything to reduce the media’s stigma of it?"
"LGB(T) Representation in the Whedonverse:", "When Willow and Tara progressed from “doing spells” to being “lesbian, gay-type lovers” in Buffy, their relationship was ground-breaking for genre television. Buffy’s impact can be seen in shows that came after, like James Cameron’s Dark Angel and Julian Jones and Lucy Watkins’ Hex where a LBF - lesbian best friend - became almost de rigeur. Ironically, as genre TV has become more open to LGB(T) representation, from True Blood to Penny Dreadful, Whedon has apparently been moving in the other direction. Join us for a discussion about all things LGB(T) in the Whedonverse."
"Whedonverse Sing-Along", "Fancy yourself the next Lorne of Caritas? Then come on over for our Whedonverse Sing-Along tonight. Join us for a night of Once More With Feeling and Dr Horrible’s Sing Along Blog fun, and a few surprises! Our favourite pianist David Merriman to accompany."
"GoT: Season 4 in Review","We look back on a very eventful season 4 and reflect on the story so far. We'll also be asking why it is the TV show is even more brutal than the books killing off characters that are still alive and well in the source material."
"GoT: Justice","A major theme of season 4 was justice. We saw Tyrion face a biased and unfair judicial trial followed by a crushing trial by combat. But many other characters faced justice of one sort or another or delivered justice. Is Daenerys right to free the slaves of Meereen delivering them into a harsh world that offers little opportunity for them? Is being sentenced to life on the Wall as a member of the Night's Watch fair justice for criminals? We'll be examining the justice systems of Westeros and discussing their fairness or lack thereof."
"GoT: Gaming Session","Join us for a session of the Game of Thrones Board Game by Fantasy Flight Games. Which House will take the Iron Throne in this game of warfare and political intrigue? We also have the awesome Firefly and Discworld: Ankh Morpork board games available to play."
"GoT: Filming Locations","TitanCon organiser Phil Lowles talks about his experiences of visiting filming locations in Northern Ireland and Dubrovnik, Croatia. With tips for reaching the hard to find locations and cool things to look out for. Phil will also answer audience questions about TitanCon."
"GoT: Going Beyond the Books","In season 4 of the show we went beyond the books for the first time with the answer to what happens to Craster's male babies. From here on out we'll be seeing many more questions answered by the TV show long before we get to read them in the books ­ almost certainly including how the story ends. The question is will fans switch off and wait for the books or see things through to the end on screen?"
"GoT: Signing","Autographs cost £15 each."
"thenineworldsfilmfestivalshortsshowcasepart1","The first session of screenings for our officially selected shorts, submitted from all over the world. This session features dystopias, robots, paranoia, bad hair days and badly run geek conventions – oh my!"

"thenineworldsfilmfestivalshortsshowcasepart3","The final session of screenings for our officially selected shorts, submitted from all over the world. This session is full of nice things, child-friendly things and people generally being nice to each other – featuring playgrounds, aliens, fantasy kingdoms and a couple of secrets of the universe."
"illusionsandbrains","The human brain is the most powerful information processing device we know, and one of its primary input devices is the eye with its millions of interconnected light receptors. And yet despite this power and complexity, we are constantly misled by even the most simple of optical illusions. Why is this? In this talk, David Corney will demonstrate a number of illusions and argue that our perceptions of them are a predictable response to ambiguous images, and a consequence of our evolution and development. He will also discuss whether it’s possible to learn to avoid seeing illusions, and whether aliens would also see them..."
"speedfriending","A quiz based speed-friending event. Want to meet other geeks and make new friends? Then this speed-friending evening from London Geek Chic is for you. You will work in small teams to answer geekdom and science questions and you can choose to stay with the team or defect to other teams, or all team members scatter, as you wish. Bottom line is, you need others to find all the answers, so you need to confer; and you want to make new friends, so you want to share... but there can only be one winner! Are you a lover or a deceiver? Please note the maximum number is (50) participants so please do arrive early to register for your place. Registration opens at 8.30pm, event starts at 9.00pm."

"cosplaypositivitymeetmingle","Are you a homesick Homestruck troll? A friendless Frank N Furter? Or just a social Spiderman?

"nineworldsfamiliesmeetup","We have a families' area set up in one corner of the main third floor Atrium: look for the space with the brightly coloured, squishy beanbags and toys. This is available as a drop-in area throughout the convention, and we'll also be running a dedicated meetup in the space at 9am every day."

After the event, you’ll be able to buy digital copies of your photos for £3 each."
"Writing Better Characters","Game stories often get the short end of the stick when people are working out where to spend their time, but starting off with strong characters can help get you through that. Our panel of writers are here to help you get strong, unique characters into your games and avoid the trap of falling back on tired old defaults."
"Sex Work and ASOIAF","Sex work is mentioned frequently in ASOIAF, but not all portrayals are good portrayals. We are joined by a panel of sex workers to give their opinions on the portrayals of sex work in the books."
